Problem: Create check out register simulation that allows input of item codes to obtain selling prices and descriptions. If incorrect code is entered then error message is put on the screen.
	 If the item is found - the quantity of items should be entered. Once all items and quantities have been entered the user should end the transaction by entering item code 0.
	 The program should build a sales slip called Sales.txt that includes item code, description, unit price, quantity purchased, and total extended price.
	 The bill will include subtotal and 8% tax added for a final total bill. The amount tendered by the customer and the change given will also be added to the invoice.
	 The invoice should be written out to an output file called Sales.txt.
Inputs: item code, quantity, Stock.txt file, cash tendered
Outputs: final bill, cash tendered, change, item code, item description, price, Sales.txt file
Formulas: change = cash tendered - (running total + (running total * .08))
