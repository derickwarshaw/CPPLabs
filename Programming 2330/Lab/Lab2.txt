Problem: Program that finds and outputs three digit integers that are equal to the sum of the cubes of their digits
Inputs: none
Outputs: numbers that equal the sum of the cubes of their digits
Formulas: extract first digit = original number / 100
          extract second digit = (remainder of (original number / 100)) / 10
          extract third digit = (remainder of (remainder of the original number / 100) / 10)
          sum of cubes = (first digit extracted * first digit extracted * first digit extracted) +
                         (second digit extracted * second digit extracted * second digit extracted)+
                         (third digit extracted * third digit extracted * third digit extracted)
start
SET original number equal to 100
SET number used for comparison to 0
SET first digit broken out to 0
SET second digit broken out to 0
SET third digit broken out to 0
REPEAT as long as original number is less than or equal to 999
	SET first digit broken out equal to extract first digit
	SET second digit broken out equal to extract second digit
	SET third digit broken out equal to extract third digit
	SET number used for comparison equal to sum of cubes
	IF comparison number is equal to original number
		DISPLAY number used for comparison
	END-IF
	SET original number equal to original number plus 1
