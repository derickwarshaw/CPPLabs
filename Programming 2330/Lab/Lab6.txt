Problem: Read in 4 digit student numbers and gpa scores from a data file into two parallel arrays.
         Once arrays are populated, sort the arrays in ascending order by GPA score and print the results to the screen.
Inputs: data from txt file that user specifies
Outputs: data assorted in ascending order by GPA
Formulas: none

start processing
INPUT from user what the name of the data file is they want to use for file input
REPEAT as long as the counter for the loop is less than the array size and stop flag is set to false
	INPUT student id from file
	INPUT gpa from file
	IF gpa is greater than 99.0
		SET stop flag = true
	END-IF
END-REPEAT
SET loops = 1
DO UNTIL loops are greater than number of array elements
	SET subscript = 0
	DO WHILE subscript is less than number of array elements - 1
		IF array(subscript) for gpa is greater than array(subscript + 1) for gpa THEN
			SET the following instructions for both array(subscript) for gpa and array(subscript) for student id
			SET temp = array(subscript)
			SET array(subscript) = array(subscript + 1)
			SET array(subscript + 1) = temp
		END-IF
		INCREMENT subscript
	END-DO
	INCREMENT loops
END-DO
SET stop showing flag = false
SET subscript = 0
REPEAT while counter is less than number of array elements and stop showing flag = false
	IF array(subscript) for gpa is greater than 99.0 THEN
	SET flag to stop showing = true
	END-IF
	IF array(subscript) for gpa is less than 99.0 THEN
	DISPLAY array(subscript) for student id and array(subscript) for gpa
