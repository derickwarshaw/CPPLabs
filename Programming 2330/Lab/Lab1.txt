Problem: Count the number of numbers entered and display that number, sum the numbers entered and display that sum,  count the number of positive, negative, and zero entries and display those counts
	 find the number entered the most times in a row and display what that number is and how many times it was entered.
Inputs: user number entry, sentinal value to end entry submission
Outputs: how many numbers were entered, sum of numbers entered, how many positive entries, how many negative entries, how many zero entries, number entered the most times in a row and how many times it was entered
Formulas: NONE

SET entry counter equal to zero	
SET positive number counter equal to zero
SET zero number counter equal to zero
SET negative number counter equal to zero
SET entry sum accumulator equal to zero
SET entry occurence counter equal to zero
SET alpha entry equal to 9999
SET beta entry equal to zero
INPUT user number entry
SET entry occurance counter equal to itself plus one
REPEAT as long as user entry is not equal to 9999
	SET entry counter equal to entry counter plus one
	SET entry sum accumulator equal to entry sum accumulator plus the user entry
	IF user entry is greater than zero
		SET positive number counter equal to positive number counter plus one
	END-IF
	IF user entry is equal to zero
		SET zero number counter equal to zero counter plus one
	END-IF
	IF user entry is less than zero
		SET negative number counter equal to zero counter plus one
	END-IF
	SET alpha entry to user number entry
	INPUT user number entry
	SET beta entry equal to user number entry
	IF alpha entry is equal to beta entry
		SET entry occurence counter equal to entry occurence counter plus one
		SET most entered number accumulator equal to alpha entry
	END-IF	
END-REPEAT
DISPLAY entry sum accumulator
DISPLAY entry counter
DISPLAY positive number counter
DISPLAY negative number counter
DISPLAY zero number counter
DISPLAY most entered number accumulator
DISPLAY entry occurence counter
