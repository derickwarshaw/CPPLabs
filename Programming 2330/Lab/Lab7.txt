Problem:Given that there is a square that is 20x20 in squares with the top row having a value of 100,
	the bottom row having a value of 32, the 2 sides having a value of 90, an inner area that is 6x6 in squares
	with a value of 212, and all of the non perimeter or inner squares with a value of 90. Find the average
	temperature. Stop making passes to find the average when the change is less than .01 .
Inputs: none
Outputs: average temperature
Formulas: change = old value - (top square + bottom square + right side side square + left side square)
