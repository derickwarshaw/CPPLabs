Problem: Create a program that will take text entered and output the text in all uppercase, reverse order, display the number of characters,
	 and then output it with the first letter lower case, the second in caps, third in lower, 4th in caps, etc.
Inputs: name
Outputs: name in uppercase, name in reverse order, number of characters in name, name arranged such that first letter lower case, the second in caps, third in lower, 4th in caps, etc.
Formulas: none
