Problem: create a table of the costs, revenue, and profit(or loss) corresponding to range of production levels.
Inputs: number of production levels to be listed
Outputs: cost at each level, revenue, profit or loss, average profit or loss
Formulas: cost = 100,000 + 12 * number of pins , total revenue = number of pins * (1000 - number of pins)
	 number of pins = 100 * production level, profit or loss = revenue - cost

GET number of production levels to be listed
REPEAT as long as number of production levels to be listed is < 1
	DISPLAY error message
	GET number of production levels to be listed
END-REPEAT
SET production level to user specification
REPEAT until number of production levels set forth by user has been reached	
	CALCULATE number of pins = 100 * production level
	CALCULATE cost = 100,000 + 12 * number of pins
	CALCULATE total revenue = number of pins * (1000 - number of pins) 
	CALCULATE profit or loss = revenue - cost
	DISPLAY cost
	DISPLAY total revenue
	DISPLAY profit/loss
	ADD 1 to production level
	IF number of production levels set forth by user has been reached
		DISPLAY average profit or loss = (total profit or loss / number of production levels)
	END-IF
END-REPEAT
