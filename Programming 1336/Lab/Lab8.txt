Problem: get number of bacteria present at beginning of observation from user and compute number of bacteria in the culture 
	 after each of the first 10 days. Display output in form of table.
Inputs:  number of bacteria present at beginning of observation.
Outputs: number of bacteria present after 10 days
Formulas: number of bacteria at end of day = number of bacteria at beginning * 2 ^ t/10 where t is the day

start
INPUT number of bacteria present at beginning of observation
REPEAT while number of starting bacteria is less than 1
	OUTPUT you cannot enter less than 1
	GET number of starting bacteria
END-REPEAT
REPEAT as long as day is less than or equal to 10
	 	SET day equal to 1
		CALCULATE number of bacteria at beginning * 2 ^ t/10 where t is the day
		DISPLAY number of bacteria present
		Add 1 to day
END-REPEAT
