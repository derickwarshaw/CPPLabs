	 "The square root of N is not defined" (N is the number that was input)
Inputs: number
Outputs: square root of the input number
Formulas: NONE

start
INPUT number
IF number is less than zero 
	OUTPUT "The square root is not defined"
ELSE
	SET square root = the square root of number that was input by user
